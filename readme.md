Quick Start Guide for RAG Project Submission
üöÄ Quick Setup

Create a new Python environment:

bashpython -m venv rag_env
source rag_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

Install all dependencies:

bashpip install langchain langchain-community chromadb pypdf gradio sentence-transformers ibm-watsonx-ai

Get your IBM watsonx credentials:

Go to IBM Cloud
Create/access your watsonx.ai instance
Copy your API key and Project ID 





üì∏ Screenshot Requirements
Each screenshot must clearly show:

The code being executed
The output or results
Save with exact filenames: pdf_loader.png, code_splitter.png, etc.

‚ö° Quick Execution Steps
For Tasks 1-5:

Copy the individual task code from the "Individual Task Scripts" artifact
Update credentials/URLs as needed
Run each script separately
Take screenshot immediately after output appears

For Task 6 (QA Bot):

Run the task6_qa_bot.py script
Wait for Gradio to launch (opens in browser)
Upload the PDF from the provided link
Type/paste: "What this paper is talking about?"
Click Submit and wait for response
Screenshot the entire interface

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Fixes
If PDF won't load (Task 1):
python# Download PDF locally first, then:
loader = PyPDFLoader("downloaded_paper.pdf")
If watsonx fails (Task 6):
python# Use a mock LLM for testing:
from langchain.llms import FakeListLLM
responses = ["This paper discusses advanced AI techniques..."]
llm = FakeListLLM(responses=responses)
If Chroma fails (Task 4/5):
bash# Clear existing database:
rm -rf ./chroma_db
‚úÖ Final Checklist
Before submission, verify:

 All 6 PNG files are created with exact names
 Each screenshot clearly shows code AND output
 No API keys are visible in screenshots
 Task 6 shows PDF uploaded and query answered
 All outputs match the requirements

üí° Pro Tips

Test first: Run a simple test before the full code
Clean screenshots: Use a light theme for better readability
Full output: Don't crop important parts of the output
Error handling: If something fails, the error message can be helpful in screenshots

üìã Submission Files
You need exactly 6 files:

pdf_loader.png - Shows PDF loading code + first 1000 chars
code_splitter.png - Shows LaTeX splitting code + all chunks
embedding.png - Shows embedding code + first 5 values
vectordb.png - Shows Chroma creation + 5 search results
retriever.png - Shows retriever code + 2 results
QA_bot.png - Shows Gradio interface with PDF and answer

üÜò Emergency Solutions
If you're running out of time:

Focus on getting all 6 screenshots even if some have errors
Document any issues in your submission notes
Use the mock/simplified versions if watsonx isn't working
Ensure file names are exactly as specified

Good luck with your Quest Analytics RAG Assistant project! üéØ
